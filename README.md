## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m John Rafael Magayano, a passionate developer who loves turning ideas into interactive and meaningful digital experiences. My journey in tech started when I pursued my BS Information Technology degree, where I discovered my enthusiasm for coding, design, and problem-solving.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Front-End Developer (UI/UX) intern, focusing on creating visually engaging, user-friendly interfaces. I enjoy blending creativity and functionality â€” making designs not only look good but feel intuitive and seamless for users.

When Iâ€™m not coding or designing, I like exploring new tools, learning emerging technologies, and finding better ways to improve user experiences.
